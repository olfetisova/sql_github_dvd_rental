### Project Title
**Investigate a Relational Database**

### Description
In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answered interesting questions about the database. As part of my project submission, I ran SQL queries and builded visualisations to showcase the output of my queries.

In this project, I queried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs.

### Files used
* dvd-rental-erd-2.pdf - the schema for the DVD Rental database
* sql-queries.txt - text file with SQL queries
* presentations.pdf - slide deck with a question, visualisation, and small summary on each slide

### Credits
I thank all teachers and mentors from the [Udacity school](https://wwww.udacity.com "Udacity home") who supported and inspired me during my study on the [Programming for Data Science with Python](https://https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104 "Course name") course.
