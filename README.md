### Project Title
**Investigate a Relational Database**

### Description
In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of my project submission, you I ran SQL queries and builded visualisations to showcase the output of my queries.
In this project, you I queried the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you I was querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

### Files used
* dvd-rental-erd-2.pdf - the schema for the DVD Rental database
* sql-queries.txt - text file with SQL queries
* presentations.pdf - slide deck with a question, visualisation, and small summary on each slide
